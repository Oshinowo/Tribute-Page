        <p class="quote">“ I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which
          I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. ”<br><br>_ _ Former President Nelson Mandela (Late)
